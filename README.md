House Price Prediction using XGBoost Regression

Developed a machine learning model using XGBoost regression to predict house prices based on a real-world dataset. Utilized data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to derive insights and improve model accuracy.

Key Contributions:

Implemented data preprocessing techniques to clean and format the California housing dataset.
Trained an XGBoost regression model to predict house prices by capturing intricate patterns in the data.
Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Created a scatter plot visualization to intuitively compare predicted and actual prices, identifying trends and potential outliers.

Skills Utilized:

Machine Learning: Developed an understanding of regression algorithms and their application to real-world problems.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted data cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Model Evaluation: Employed evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and make informed decisions for improvement.
Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib to create informative scatter plots for visualizing model performance.
Python Programming: Employed libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and XGBoost to implement the project.
